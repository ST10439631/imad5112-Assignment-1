My History application which is an android application. It compares user's agess to famous figures from history. It is belived that this app will only be educational and fun for students who are doing History as a subject. This App will basically take a person's age as input and then match the age to the age of different people in History when they passed away.
However, Sarah a history teacher asked me to create a mobile application that will be comparing ages of historical people who died a long time ago with the user's age.

Moreover, This is how i managed to do my mobile application:
I created an android app that asked for a user's age upon launch.
I compared the input age to the ages of various historical figures at the time of their deaths.
I made sure that students enjoy using the application and actually get knowledge of it.
I used GitHub to implement version control.

Development Process:
Requirements Gathering: Sarah's motif for the mobile application was the first stage in the process.It requires  the features she desired,the inteded audience, and the learning goals.
Design Phase: I made a wireframes and mockups after gathering all the requirements.The design should be user friendly and intresting for the students.
Development: I used Android Studio  as my developmental environment. During the process of of the development phase, the following essential components were put into place.
User input for age
Historical ages of famous figures
Matching the user's name with famous historical people

Therefore, I created a GitHub repository for the project in oder to accommodate the effective communication and version control. This is possible for Sarah and I to manage the code revisions.
I ensured that the operation of crucial application components, i've put tests into place.To automate the testing procedure,these tests were incoporated into GitHub Actions.
GitHub actions were used to automate the build process in addition to testing. The application was automatically constructed when testing was completed.

Features of the application:
1. Age Input: The User enters their age
2. Historical Comparison: When a user uses this program, their age is compared to famous historical people
3. Educational Content: Details are being displayed and should be intresting.
4. Interactive Interface: Learners should learn more effectively and enjoy using the application.
5. Personalization: Viewers have the ability to change the presentation elements and explore into several historical personal categories

Benefits of the application:
1. Educational Value : The app is a great resource for teacher and it actually makes studying more fun and interesting.
2. Engagement: The applcation draws back young people's curosity and promotes active learning
3. Convinience: By making historical material widely accessible onmobile devices, user's can even promote learning outside traditional classroom settings
4. Flexibility: To reach a larger audience, the application can be developed in the future to incorporate more features and historical data.


In conclusion, The mobile application has been developed successfully and it reached Sarah's goal of developing an application that will be intresting for her history class.I have created a learning experience that blends history with interactive mobile technologies by using technology. The Mobile Application's maintability and stability are guranteed by the use of GitHub Actions for automated testing and version control. The Program has the potential to inspire young minds and enhance a geater appreciation for history due to its user-friendly interface and instructive information.

Future Enhancements:
More Historical figures: Increase the number of historical figures from a variety of fields.
